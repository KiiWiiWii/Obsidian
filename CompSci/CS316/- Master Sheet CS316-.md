## Week 1:

This class is using Haskell and is group work. Haskell was covered in CS260 Which we didn't have, so some [[Haskell stuff]] can be found here, with an [[Introductory Problem]], but more work at home will be needed.

In the Friday lecture we're looking at the concatenation of Strings using markUp tools.[[Examples of markup]].
