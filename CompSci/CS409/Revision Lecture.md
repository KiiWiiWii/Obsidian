## What the Exam looks like

Made up of three types of questions - multiple choice, short form answer (sentence per mark), and finally a long form question which is more of a short essay (im assuming there's like a paragraph not actually a few pages)

Need to compare and contrast similar patterns so the devil is in the details when studying i.e. builder and factory are quite similar

Need to know the UML classes to know what classes are part of each pattern.

## Example Questions

    - Looking for 2 sentences.

What are the essential steps in the implementation of the singleton pattern - 2 marks
