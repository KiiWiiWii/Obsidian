# Introduction
How to **structure** large scale projects.
Labs 2-3 On Tuesday, labs are assessed.
70& exam and 30% coursework (due in week 4 7 and 10), done online on my place.
# Design Patterns

### What and why?

"A named nugget of insight" - basically a certain named way to solve a recurring problem.

Don't implement anything yourself basically, just reuse stuff from people who know better.

Patterns originate from architecture, the idea that a window is a window and a door is a door, introduced to compsci by the "gang of 4" fucking reddit mods
