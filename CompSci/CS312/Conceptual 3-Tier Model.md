# Conceptual 3-Tier Model

This is split up into 3 tiers, the top one being the presentation tier where everything that the user can input / see is shown. Right below it is the logic tier where the users inputs are processed and dealt with, and below that is the data tier where information is accessed and retrieved / written.

I.e:
	Presentation
		HTML
		CSS
	Logic
		JavaScript
		PHP
	Data
		MySQL
