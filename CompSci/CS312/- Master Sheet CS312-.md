## Week 1:

In lecture 1 we went over [[TCP IP Layered Architecture]], going over a [[Conceptual 3-Tier Model]]. This was apparently expected to be known and was explained (poorly). 

The [[Basic Client server request response]] goes over how a client and server interact. Some [[Names of clients and servers]] (blank cause he skipped it).

On the client, it uses [[HTML5]] (this is literally like cs101 type shit its a basic ass file). HTML implements CSS, I'm not even gonna make a new note for this because its literally ` 
`<style> h1{...} </style>` like c'mon man... Same thing for basic ass JavaScript.
