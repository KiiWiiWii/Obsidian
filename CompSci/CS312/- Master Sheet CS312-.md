## Week 1:

In lecture 1 we went over [[TCP IP Layered Architecture]], going over a [[Conceptual 3-Tier Model]]. This was apparently expected to be known and was explained (poorly). 

The [[Basic Client server request response]] goes over how a client and server interact. Some [[Names of clients and servers]] (blank cause he skipped it).

On the client, it uses [[HTML5]].
