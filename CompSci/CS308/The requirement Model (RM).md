## The requirement Model (RM)

Basically it takes user requirements and transforms them into technical requirements.

A system use case diagram (SUCD) describes the interaction between the system actors and the system use cases (services).

A system use case (narrative) is basically a play with an actor imagining how they'd use it.

_This is insanely simple and we've covered this a million times, think of the user stories we did for cows and bulls._
