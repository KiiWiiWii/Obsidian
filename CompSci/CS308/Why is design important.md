# Why is design important

Given a requirement "A user should be able to sign up", a design with just fields `Username, Email and Password` it may fail because design depends on how easy it is for the user to be able to use it. For instance, adding an additional field of `Re-type Password` would be helpful to allow the user to validate they have the right password typed.
