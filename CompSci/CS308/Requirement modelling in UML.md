UML stand for Unified Modelling Language and its just a standardized way of communicating design language.

Modelling is important because it helps to visualize the final product, identify the problems with it and also save resources. We can use any one of these [[UML Diagrams]]

## The requirement Model (RM)

Basically it takes user requirements and transforms them into technical requirements.

A system use case diagram (SUCD) describes the interaction between the system actors and the system use cases (services).

A system use case (narrative) is basically a play with an actor imagining how they'd use it.

_This is insanely simple and we've covered this a million times, think of the user stories we did for cows and bulls._
