UML stand for Unified Modelling Language and its just a standardized way of communicating design language.

Modelling is important because it helps to visualize the final product, identify the problems with it and also save resources. We can use any one of these [[UML Diagrams]]

We go over what is basically user stories with a new name and coat of paint. For more info -> [[The requirement Model (RM)]].

I've given up on the developing system use case diagram it's common sense just look at the slides for 30 seconds you'll get it.

Everything else after is also such a pisstake fuck off.
