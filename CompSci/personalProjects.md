## High candidates:

### ABEL01 Trains and games.

Basically using ai to design trains in games - literally perfect for factorio. (Would need to contact Andrew Abel about doing a system for factorio.)

### BMIT02 Latex Linter

This is just like my "Fast latex" addon in obisidian, and i have a lot of experience with latex, so it could be good for me, not sure how i'll feel about it tomorrow though.

### GEMA01 Build your own AI game agent

This sounds cool, like all of the ones i listed but this is literally just making an advanced macro, a bot to play any video game (factorio!?!?!), so this would be a cool contendor for me.

## Very Interesting

### CLIF03 - Boardgames, Wargames and AI

This would be just to make a bot that can watch you play board games or video games and say if you broke the rules also create an opponent, im assuming that this would be specifically made for as single game and not be abstracted to literally everything you throw at it.

### ELAW03 Intelligent Street-View Analysis

Just making the backend for cameras for like slef driving cars, sounds cool and i bet it would be fun but i dont know if i would necessarily enjoy it.

## Interesting But not Top Of The List

### ANDE05 Gamification - The Next Level

This sounds interesting, basically take any meanial task and make it a game. This is already done in ways like duolingo or whatever to an extent but i find it not to be terribly effective in teaching and hence probably wouldnt produce a good product here

## Other comments

### ANDE01 Good parent AI

This literally sounds like nothing since its just "ai to explain the rules of a game", it makes no sense, it's already a feature on chatGPT with specific GPT's, i don't get it.

### BMIT03 STUMAEGAATOHS

The title is abbreviated cause its so fucking long but this is about basically making omori. Don't understand how this is worth a dissertation
