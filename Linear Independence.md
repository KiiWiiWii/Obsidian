In the context of vectors, $\underline{u}$ and $\underline{v}$ $\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and Linearly Dependent if the exists some non 0 constants $c_{1},c_{2}$ such that $$
c_{1}\underline{u}+c_{2}\underline{v}=0
$$
For functions, it is similar, we say that for functions which are differentiable are also linearaly dependent if there exists some non 0 constants $c_{1},c_{2}$ such that $$
c_{1}f(x)
$$
