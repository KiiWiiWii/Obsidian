I'm really tired so i'm not gonna write a lot but this week we're looking at inhomogeneous equations now and only steady-state solutions so that it is independent on time. 

Do NOT put one end of a metal bar in the freezer and another in the oven!!!! Don't do it!!! (This was just an example of it eventually reaching an equilibrium)

I got distracted for like 10 mins

I gave up its 10:32 i can hardly keep my eyes open
