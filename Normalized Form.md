To normalize an ODE in the form of $a_{2}y'' + a_{1}y + ay = 0$ we typically want to put in a normalized form. This is literally just dividing the equation through by $a_{2}$, assuming it is not 0.$$
y'' + \frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}y' + \frac{a_{0}}{a_{2}}y = 0
$$
We will also define $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ as the coefficients of $y'$ and $y$ respectively. $p(x) = \frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}$, $q(x) = \frac{a_{0}}{a_{2}}$.
