Assume that it can be written as 2 functions, one of time and one of space. Assume then that the general solution is a multiplication of these two functions. It only works if the equation is linear.

# Definition 14

Consider a Sturm-Liouville problem $L[y] + \lambda \sigma (x)y=0$. The values of the parameter $\lambda$ for which there exists nontrivial solutions of the problem are called eigenvalues. The corresponding nontrivial solutions $y(x)$ are called eigenfunctions.
