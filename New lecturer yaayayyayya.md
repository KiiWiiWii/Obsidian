# Partial differentiation

Starting with homogeneous PDE's : Change them into an ODE and then assume we can solve it.

Notation or something: 

We know what a single variable function looks like: $f(x) = x^{2}$ or whatever. Differentiation looks like $f'(x)= 2x$ or just $f'$. Revision about the product and the quotient rule. Whatever. Also looking at the chain rule. $$
