# Partial differentiation

Starting with homogeneous PDE's : Change them into an ODE and then assume we can solve it.

Notation or something: 

We know what a single variable function looks like: $f(x) = x^{2}$ or whatever. Differentiation looks like $f'(x)= 2x$ or just $f'$. Revision about the product and the quotient rule. Whatever. Also looking at the chain rule.

Now for functions of more than one variable like $f(x,y,z)$ so we need to say what kind of differentiation we're doing $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ . Very important to use the curly d rather then the normal d or you lose marks. $$
f(x,y) = x^{2} + \frac{1}{y}
$$
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = - \frac{1}{y^{2}}$. And so on for more variables. Pretty simple. Second order differentiation notation is also fine $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}$
