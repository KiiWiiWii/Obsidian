First few minutes of the lecture are just covering page 15 of the notes.

Let $(\phi _{j})_{j=0}^{n}$ be an orrhogonal basis
$$
\langle \phi_{i},\phi _{j} \rangle = 0 \text{   if i != j}
$$
--- i zoned out copying this ---

#### Orthonormal definition defintion:

Basis $\underline{s}$ is orthogonal if each element has norm 1

$$
\langle \phi _{i},\phi _{j} \rangle  = 0 \ \ \ \text{i != j}
$$
$$
|| \phi _{i} || =1
$$
## Example 2.5

Inner prod here is
$$
\langle u,v \rangle = \int _{-1}^{1}u(x)v(x) \, dx
$$
If we can show that $\phi_{0},\phi_{1},\phi_{2}$ is orthogonal then they are linearly independent. There are 3 of them which would math the dimension of the space of $P_{2}$ so it must be a basis.
