# Properties of a vector space
### Zero Element

$$
\underline{0} \in V
$$
Such that $$
\underline{0} + u = u = u + \underline{0}
$$
Note, If $u \in V$ then $0u= \underline{0}$. Basically just like 0 normally just as a element of a vector

### Inverse Element

If $u \in V$, then $\exists u^{-}$ with $u + u ^{-} = \underline{0}$.
Note $u^{-} = (-1)u$ Because from the axiom $$
(\alpha + \beta)u = \alpha u + \beta u
$$
Follows
$$
(1 +(-1))u= 1\times u + (-1)u
$$
Since $1 + -1 = 0$ then this proves the statement.

### Example 1.1

Show that the following are vector spaces

##### 1.

$$
V = \mathbb{R}^{n}
$$
Looking at properties 1 and 2 from definition 1.1 
$$
\underline{u}, \underline{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}
$$
$$
\implies \underline{u} = (u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{n})
$$
$$
\underline{v} = (v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{n})
$$
We need to show that $u + v$ and $Nu, Nv$ are in the space.
$$
\underline{u} + \underline{v} = (u_{1}+v_{1}, u_{2}+v_{2},\dots,u_{n}+v_{n})
$$
Since $u_{i},v_{i} \in \mathbb{R}$
