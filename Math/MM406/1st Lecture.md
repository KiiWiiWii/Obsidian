Need to get the first few points from the first page of the handwritten pages

# Properties of a vector space
### Zero Element

$$
\underline{0} \in V
$$
Such that $$
\underline{0} + u = u = u + \underline{0}
$$
Note, If $u \in V$ then $0u= \underline{0}$. Basically just like 0 normally just as a element of a vector

### Inverse Element

If $u \in V$, then $\exists u^{-}$ with $u + u ^{-} = \underline{0}$.
Note $u^{-} = (-1)u$ Because $$
(\alpha + \beta)
$$


(The proof is in the handwritten notes that i didn't get time to copy down)
