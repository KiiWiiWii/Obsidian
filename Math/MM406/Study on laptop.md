## Best Approximation

For some space $\mathcal{A}$, which is finite dimensional subspace of some space $V$, some element $v \in V$, there is also some element $a\star \in \mathcal{A}$ which is the minimum distance from $v$ i.e. $$
|| v - a\star ||  \leq ||  v - a ||  \ \ \ \ \forall a \in \mathcal{A}
$$
## Example 2.1

Finding the best approximations of $v=(1,1)^{T}$ from $\mathcal{A}$ in both $l_{2}$ and $l_{\infty}$ norms when $\mathcal{A} = (x,y)^{T} : x =0$.
