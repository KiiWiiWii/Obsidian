# Chapter 3: 2D

The PDE we will be looking at is as follows:
![[Pasted image 20251118100850.png]]

The most used boundary condition is $u(\underline{x}) =0$ where $\underline{x} \in \Gamma$.

$$
D = \begin{pmatrix}
d_{11} & d_{12} \\
d_{21} & d_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Which in most cases is symmetric, and 

### Example:

$$
D = Id = \begin{pmatrix}
 1  &  0 \\
0 & 1 
\end{pmatrix}
$$
then 
$$
D \nabla u = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\nabla u = \nabla u
$$

So then

$$
dv = ( D \nabla u) = dv ( I\nabla u) = div(\nabla u)
$$
$$
= \partial x(\partial xu) + \partial y(\partial yu) = \Delta u
$$
### Example 13

$$
D = \begin{pmatrix}
1 - M^{2} & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
$$
D\nabla u = ( 1 - M^{2})\partial xu+\partial yu
$$
$$
\implies div(D\nabla u) = (1 - M^{2}) \partial x x u + \partial y y u
$$
Note that $(1-M^{2})>0$.

### Boundary Value Problem

$$
- dv(D\nabla u) = f \text{ in } \Omega
$$
$$
u =0 \text{ on } \Gamma
$$
We will first define conditions on $\Omega$:

We will assume that $\Omega$ is open, bounded, and with a polynomial Boundary.

The main quality is that we can define a unique boundary norm.

To find the weak form, we will multiply out BVP by $v \in H^{1}_{0}(\Omega)$ and then integrate over $\Omega$ to get:
$$
- \int _{\Omega}dv ( D\nabla u)v \, dx = \int _{\Omega} fv \, dx 
$$
We want to pass at least one derivative to the test function so we can weaken the conditions on u.

`Seriously what the fuck is this`

using greens formula our integral turns into

$$
= - \int _{\Omega} ( D \nabla u) . \nabla v \, dx + \int _{\Gamma} ( D \nabla u) . \underline{n}dv \, ds
$$
$$
\implies \int  _{\Omega} (D \nabla u). \nabla v \, dx - \int _{\Gamma} (D \nabla u) . \underline{n}v \, ds = \int _{\Omega} fv \, dx 
$$
Because we get that v is $=0$, our $\Gamma$ integral turns to 0 since $v|_{\Gamma} = 0$.

So the weak from is Find $u \in H^{1}_{0}(\Omega)$ such that
$$
\boxed{\int _{\Omega} (D \nabla u). \nabla v \, dx = \int _{ \Omega} fv \, dx \text{ }\ \ \  \ \forall v \in H^{1}_{0}(\Omega)}
$$

### Example 15
![[Pasted image 20251118105105.png]]

$$
D = \begin{pmatrix}
k & 0 \\
0 & k
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Here
$$
(D \nabla u) = \begin{pmatrix}
k & 0 \\
0 & k
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
\partial x & u \\
\partial x & v
\end{pmatrix} = k \nabla u
$$
So the weak form is, find $u \in H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)$ such that
$$
\int _{\Omega} k(x) \nabla u \times \nabla v \, dx = \int _{\Omega} fv \, dx  \forall  v \in H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)
$$
$\square$

The basis $\phi_{i}$ will be the $x_{i}$ that are not on the edge, $\notin \Gamma$

The FEM for 2D is the exact same process that it is in 1D

![[Pasted image 20251118112200.png]]

Each node can only see its neighbors, hence for points that are far away we get that $a_{ij} = 0$, if they are not part of the same element, i.e. they do not have an edge between each other.

As a consequence, the matrix $\mathcal{A}$ is spares, it is not tridiagonal as it was in 1D.

### Main Algorithmic Remark:

In practice the meshes are generated by software. We want to get a list of the coords of the nodes, list of elements and which nodes are part of which elements. Do not integrate over the entire domain.


$$
a_{ij} = \int  _{ \Omega} ( D \nabla \phi _{j}). \nabla \phi_{i} \, dx 
$$
$$
= \sum_{K} \int  _{K} ( D \nabla \phi _{j}) . \nabla \phi _{i} \, dx 
$$
This integral will be denoted by $a_{ij}^{K}$

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{A} = \sum_{k\in \tau} \mathcal{A}^{K}}
$$
## Big remark!!!

its a drawing so i cant note it lol

Here, 
$$
a_{ij}^{k} \neq 0
$$
$$
a_{jk}^{k} \neq 0

$$
$$
a_{il}^{k} \neq 0
$$
$$
a_{jz}^{k} = \int  _{K} ( D \nabla \phi _{z}) . \nabla \phi _{j} \, dx = 0 
$$
So the only non zero elements are those associated to the nodes $x_{i}, x_{j}, x_{l}$ that belong to K. Hence $\mathcal{A}^{K}$ is a 3x3 matrix in disguise.

Algorithm; to build $\mathcal{A}$ we need to lop over the elements and build their local matrix.

### local numbering

just a way of standardising the notation, i.e. a triangle $k$ with edges $x_{4},x_{6},x_{2}$ can be just made into local points called $l_{1},l_{2},l_{3}$.

Local numbering is always counted clockwise.
