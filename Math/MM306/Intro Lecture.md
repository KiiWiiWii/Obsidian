## What is numerical analysis?

When you collect data on a phenomenon, process, whatever, you normally would make a mathematical model, then an a numerical algorithm to turn into code and make it visual. Numerical analysis is the process of taking a mathematical model and turning it into a numerical algorithm.

## Interpolation

### Example 1.2

Compute the value of the function $$
\frac{1 - \cos x}{x^{2}}
$$
when $$
x = 1.2 \times 10^{-5}
$$
---

Here for any value of $x$ we have $$
o \leq f(x) \leq \frac{1}{2}
$$
