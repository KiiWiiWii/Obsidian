Considering some function 

$$
f(x) = -(x + 4)\cos (\pi x)
$$
For $x \in [-1,2]$, if we want to find newtons form for ts, we would use a divided difference table, which i know how to do, and then put it in the form 
$$
p_{2} = n_{0}\pi _{0}(x) + n_{1}\pi _{1}(x) + n_{2}\pi _{2}(x) 
$$
Where each $n_{i}$ is some the related divided difference result, and 
$$
\pi _{i}(x) = \sum_{i = 0}
$$
