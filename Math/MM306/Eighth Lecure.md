## Fixed point iteration

#### Background - Intermediate value theorem

If you have some continuous function evaluated at $(a,b)$, and $f(a)<y<f(b)$ then there exists some $c \in (a,b)$, such that $f(c) = y$. Moreover, if $f(a)<0 \ \ \ \ f(b) > 0$, then there is some $c \ \ s.t. \ \ f(c) = 0$.

#### Fixed point method

Instead of working with some problem in the form:

Find $\alpha$

$$
f(\alpha) = 0
$$

We can instead do 

Find $\alpha$
$$
g(\alpha) = \alpha
$$
Here $\alpha$ is a fixed point of $g$.
