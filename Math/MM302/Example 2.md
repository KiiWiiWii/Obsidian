Example 2 really only demonstrates that a function can have different [[ConvergenceAndDivergence]] depending on the value of x.

Take $$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = 1+x+x^{2}+x^{3}+\dots
$$
Depending on $x$, its [[Partial Sums]] will either diverge or converge.

When $x=0$ then the sums are all equal to $1$.
When $x \in (-1, 1) /{0}$, it converges to some number.
For any $x$ outside this interval, this sum diverges.
