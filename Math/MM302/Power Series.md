Power series are generally in the form $$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n}(x + x_{0})^n
$$
and we focus on the expansion of this. $a_{n}$ is the coefficient and $x_{0}$ is the constant.

Power series also can be odd or even, depending on the powers that specifically apply to the $x$.

### Odd:
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{2n+1} x^{2n+1}
$$
### Even:
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{2n} x^{2n}
$$
A solution will come in the form of the sum of an odd and even series. <- this is kinda just "it is what it is" and can be ignored tbh.
