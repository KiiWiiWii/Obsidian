Example 4 is a quick one to show how to change the index term of a power series.

[[Note on the index]].

Given $\sum_{n=2}^\infty a_{n}n(n-2)x^{n-2}$, rewrite this to have a generic term in $x^n$.

I hope this will stay obvious to me but we can use some dummy variable $p = n-2$. Rewriting this we can see that it would be:$$
f(x) = \sum_{p=0}^\infty a_{p+2}(p+2)px^p
$$
