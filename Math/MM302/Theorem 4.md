While $f$ is a power series with a non-0 $R > |x-x_{0}|$, we can differentiate it as normal.
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n}(x-x_{0})^n
$$
$$
f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty na_{n}(x-x_{0})^{n-1}
$$
Note that when a power series is differentiated, the index will start +1 from the origin (notice how $n=0$ became $n=1$).
