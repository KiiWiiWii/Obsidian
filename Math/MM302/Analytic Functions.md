This in the notes is definition 5. A function is said to be 'analytic' at $x_{0}$ if the Taylor series associated with $f(x)$ exists and converges to $f(x)$ $\forall x$ in some open interval $x_{n}$.

Some examples of analytic functions are:
	- Polynomial functions
	- Sin
	- Cos
	- Exponential

These are everywhere and thus have a special name. In particular, rational functions ($\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$) is analytic $\forall x$ except when $g(x) = 0$ (duh).
