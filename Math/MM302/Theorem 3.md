Adding and multiplying power series is actually very intuitive.

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ where $f$ and $g$ have the form of a regular [[Power Series]] with an $\exists R$. The following is true for $|x-x_{0}| < R$:

$f(x) \pm g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_{f} \pm a_{y})(x-x_{0})^n$

	Where $a_{f}$ and $a_{g}$ are the coeffeicients of $f$ and $g$
