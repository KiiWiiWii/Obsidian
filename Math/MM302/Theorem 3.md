Adding and multiplying power series is actually very intuitive.

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ where $f$ and $g$ have the form of a regular [[Power Series]] with an $\exists R$. The following is true for $|x-x_{0}| < R$:

$f(x) \pm g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_{f} \pm a_{g})(x-x_{0})^n$

Where $a_{f}$ and $a_{g}$ are the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ respectively. We also find that:

$f(x)g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_{n}(x-x_{0})^n$

Where $c_{n}$ is the *sum* of all the coefficients of $f$ and $g$. i.e.:

$(a_{f_{1}} + a_{g_{1}} )+( a_{f_{2}} + a_{g_{2}} )+ \dots + (a_{f_{n}} + a_{g_{n}}) = c_{n}$
