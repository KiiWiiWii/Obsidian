There really isn't much class information for this class.

The class is a continuation of ODE's, so general solutions will need to be revised from last year.

## Week 1:

The focus of this week has been about [[Power Series]]. In the past, ODE's have had a nice solution, in the form of $general \ Solution = complementary \ Function + particular \ Integral.$and everything sorts itself out. In this class we're really looking at ODE's with a Power Series solution. 

With power series, we generally cannot compute an infinite series, so we look at the [[Partial Sums]], and their [[ConvergenceAndDivergence]]. To determine the [[Radius of Convergence]] we can use the [[Ratio Test]].

In the [[Ratio Test]], $R$ is introduced as the radius of convergence. [[Radius of Convergence]] includes Theorem 1 and describes for what values of $x$ this radius is defined or not. After the [[Ratio Test]] is introduced, it is immediately made obsolete by the better ratio test - [[Theorem 2]].

For when we have specifically an odd or even series, we need to apply the [[Ratio Test]] differently. We do that by [[Changing Notation for odd and even function]].

Next lecture, we learn how to deal with the sum and product of power series in [[Theorem 3]]. Further more, we can differentiate power series [[Theorem 4]]. Taylor and Maclaurin come back in [[Definition 4]], and are essential for understanding [[Analytic Functions]] (Definition 4).

## Week 2:

We only had one class this week so this section might be a bit shorter than the others. The focus was on series solutions for homogeneous equations with the form:$$
a_{2} (x) y'' + a_{1}(x)y' + a_{0}y = 0
$$
Where each '$a$' function is a polynomial. Examples of these equations are [[Bessels Equation]] and [[Legendres Equation]]. 

To solve these sort of equations we typically put them in [[Normalized Form]]. 
[[Definition 6]] explains ordinary points. [[Definition 7]] explains if a single point is regular or irregular.
[[Theorem 5]] shows the general solution to a 2nd order linear differential equation.

Recap of what [[Linear Independence]] is.

A more concrete way to actually solve these equations is using the [[Method of undetermined coefficients]].
