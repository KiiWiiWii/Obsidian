There really isn't much class information for this class.

The class is a continuation of ODE's, so general solutions will need to be revised from last year.

## Week 1:

The focus of this week has been about [[Power Series]]. In the past, ODE's have had a nice solution, in the form of 

$general Solution = complementary Function + particular Integral.$

and everything sorts itself out. In this class we're really looking at ODE's with a Power Series solution. 

With power series, we generally cannot compute an infinite series, so we look at the [[Partial Sums]], and their [[Convergence / Divergence]]. To determine the [[Radius of Convergence]] we can use the [[Ratio Test]].

In the [[Ratio Test]], $R$ is introduced as the radius of convergence. [[Theorem 1]] describes for what values of $x$ this radius is defined or not. After the [[Ratio Test]] is introduced, it is immediately made obsolete by the better ratio test - [[Theorem 2]].

Next lecture, we learn how to deal with the sum and product of power series. [[Theorem 3]]. Further more, we can differentiate power series [[Theorem 4]]. Taylor and Maclaurin come back in [[Definition 4]], and are essential for understanding [[Analytic Functions]].
