There really isn't much class information for this class.

The class is a continuation of ODE's, so general solutions will need to be revised from last year.

## Week 1:

The focus of this week has been about [[Power Series]]. In the past, ODE's have had a nice solution, in the form of 

$general Solution = complementary Function + particular Integral.$

and everything sorts itself out. In this class we're really looking at ODE's with a Power Series solution.
