# Theorem 1

The radius of convergence $R$ is just the values of which $|x-x_{0}| < R$  will allow the series to converge. 

If a series converges $\forall x$, then $R = \infty$. If it only (trivially) converges for $x=x_{0}$ then $R=0$.

_This case is trivial because the expansion is = 0, so it'll only sum to the first coefficient as $n\to \infty$ or 0._

What's more interesting is when $0 < R <\infty$, and to find this value we use the [[Ratio Test]].
