If $x_{0}$ is an ordinary point ([[Definition 6]]) of the Homogeneous 2nd order linear equation with function coefficients $a_{n}$, then the general solution will be of the form $$
y= \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n}(x-x_{0})^n = a_{0}y_{1}(x)+a_{1}y_{2}(x)
$$
Where $a_{0}$ and $a_{1}$ are arbitrary constants, and $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are
[[Linear Independence]] power series solutions that are analytic at $x_{0}$. These power series converge in some interval $|x -x_{0}| < R, \ \ (R>0)$ around $x_{0}$.
