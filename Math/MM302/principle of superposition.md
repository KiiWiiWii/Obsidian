The superposition principle states that we can use a solution for and ODE using a combination of homogenous and particular solutions.
It basically is the reason that the complementary function + the particular integral is the general solution.

_the particulars are not important for this class and this entire thing was kinda just dropped out of nowhere for seemingly no reason._
