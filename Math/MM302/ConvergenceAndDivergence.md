When we talk about convergence and divergence, what we're really talking about is if the [[Partial Sums]] of the power series converge or diverge. This part is pretty intuitive.

A power series will converge if $$
\lim_{ m \to \infty } \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n}(x-x_{0})^n
$$
and will converge absolutely if $$
\lim_{ m \to \infty } \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a_{n}(x-x_{0})^n|
$$
Note that when $x=x_{0}$ then we get 1 as the solution. It shows that the power sreies converges around its center $x_{0}$ but honestly, not that important and who cares.
