# Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations

let $$
\dot{x} =a_{11}(t)\times(t) + a_{12}(t)y(t) + g_{1}(t)
$$
$$
\dot{y} =a_{21}(t)\times(t) + a_{22}(t)y(t) + g_{2}(t)
$$

Where $\dot{x} = \frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\dot{y} = \frac{dy}{dt}$, $a,g$ functions are given continuous functions of $t$ on a given interval $\alpha < t < \beta$.

# Example of where these arise

In infectious diseases modelling, we can think of a host population being broken up into compartments. We will be looking at the most simple form of this.
We look at a simple-susceptible-infected recovered model. Hosts belong to one of these three compartment groups.
