# Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations

let $$
\dot{x} =a_{11}(t)\times(t) + a_{12}(t)y(t) + g_{1}(t)
$$
$$
\dot{y} =a_{21}(t)\times(t) + a_{22}(t)y(t) + g_{2}(t)
$$
# Example of where these arise

In infectious diseases modelling, we can think of a host population being broken up into compartments.
