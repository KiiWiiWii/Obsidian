# Even and odd functions

An even function is one where $f(-x) = f(x)$, and an odd one is where $f(x) = -f(x)$. Graphically, even functions are mirrored while odd functions are flipped.

In terms of integrals, An even function between $-a$ and $a$ would be $2\int _{0}^{a}$, while an odd one would be $0$ between $- a$ and $a$.

Additionally, a function can be piece wise smooth on an interval if it may be broke up into a finite number of pieces in which $f$ and $f'$ are continuous.

If $f$ is discontinuous at a point $x_{0}$ then it is said to have a jump discontinuity at that point.
