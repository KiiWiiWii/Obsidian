# Even and odd functions

An even function is one where $f(-x) = f(x)$, and an odd one is where $f(x) = -f(x)$. Graphically, even functions are mirrored while odd functions are flipped.

The lecturer is shitposting

In terms of integrals, An even function between $-a$ and $a$ would be $2\int _{0}^{a}$, while an odd one would be $0$ between $- a$ and $a$.
