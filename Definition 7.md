A single point $x = x_{0}$ is called a regular single point if $(x-x_{0})p(x)$ and $(x-x_{0})^{2}q(x)$ are [[Analytic Functions]] at $x = x_{0}$. Else it is called an irregular single point.


This definition is really weirdly worded, cause if $x=x_{0}$ then you would think that $x-x_{0}$ would be $0$, but $x$ is just a static variable, and $x_{0}$ is our chosen point (often 0). It makes more sense after a few examples so refer $
