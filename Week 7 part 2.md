- Continuation from the heat equation in the last lecture.

Solutions to a lot of PDE's can be found with this method.
There can NOT be mixed derivatives ($\frac{\partial u}{\partial x\partial t}$)

It works for the heat equations, wave and Laplace's.

Suppose $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(t)$ and they are equal for all $f_{1}(x) =f_{2}(t)$. The there must be a constant $\lambda$ for which $$
f_{1}(x) = f_{2}(t) = \lambda
$$

cba typing all that.
