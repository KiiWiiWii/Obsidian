# Separation of Variables

- Continuation from the heat equation in the last lecture.

Solutions to a lot of PDE's can be found with this method.
There can NOT be mixed derivatives ($\frac{\partial u}{\partial x\partial t}$)

It works for the heat equations, wave and Laplace's.

Suppose $f_{1}(x)$ and $f_{2}(t)$ and they are equal for all $f_{1}(x) =f_{2}(t)$. The there must be a constant $\lambda$ for which $$
f_{1}(x) = f_{2}(t) = \lambda
$$

cba typing all that.

Clearly $u=0$ is a solution, but it doesn't satisfy the IC, so we are only interested in non zero solutions.

Basically, suppose that $u(x,t)$ can be written as $X(x)T(t)$, then derive it. Now sub it into the heat equation: $$
XT'=t \implies \frac{T'}{kT = }
$$
