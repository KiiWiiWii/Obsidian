Consider the ODE $$
(x- 2)y'' + xy' + \frac{1}{x}y = 0
$$
We want to put this into its [[Normalized Form]]. We identify $a_{2}=(x-2)$, so we divide through by it: $$
y'' + \frac{x}{x-2}y' + \frac{1}{x^{2}-2x}y =0
$$
And we get that $p(x) = \frac{x}{x-2}$ and $q(x) = \frac{1}{x^{2}-2x}$. Clearly we will have issues for these if $x=2,0$, so for all other points of $x$, $p,q$ are ordinary.

From [[Definition 7]] we can find if they are regular single points or irregular. Since our problematic points are $x = 2,0$, we will choose these to be our $x_{0}$. Lets look at $x =2$ first:$$
(x-2)p(x) = 
$$
