# Second order PDE's

Using the discriminant $B^{2} - 4AC$ we can find the type of equation the PDE is. when it is $> 0$, we get a hyperbolic equation. An example of this is the wave equation $\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} - c^{2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} ={0}$

When it is $= 0$ we get a parabolic equation. An example of this is $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - k\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0$.

Finally when it is $<0$ we get a elliptic equation. An example of this is Laplace's fuck ass equation. $\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}$.

In this lecture we're going over how to solve only the wave equation.

Note that the coefficients do not need to be constant in a PDE.

# Example 6.1

Determine the regions where the Tricomi equation $$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + x\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
$$
