In this example, we find the Maclaurin series solution to the IVP $$
y''= -\sin(y), \ y(0) = \frac{\pi}{4}, \ y'(0) = - \frac{\pi}{4}
$$
up until the $4^{th}$ term. Remember that in the second derivative, $y$ is the same as $y(x)$. From the IVP we get $$
y''=-\sin(y)

$$
so, $$
y''(0) = -\sin(y(0))
$$
$$
y''(0) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}
$$
Following this to find $y'''(0)$, using the chain rule as $y$ depends on $x$. We'll find that:
