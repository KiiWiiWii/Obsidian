# Phase plane analysis

Consider $\underline{\dot{x}} = A\underline{x}$ and assume that $$\underline{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x(t) \\

y(t)\end{bmatrix}$$
is a solution.

1. Plot he graph of the solutions $x(t), y(t)$ over the t-axis
2. Regard the solution as a parametric representation of a curve with parameter $t$ in the x-y plane, called a phase plane.
