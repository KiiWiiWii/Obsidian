# Phase plane analysis

Just check the notes the lecturer wrote : [[4_MM302_phase-plane.pdf]].

# Example 2.3

In [[4_MM302_phase-plane.pdf]].

### steps:
1. Find the GS
2. Find the critical point(s).
3. Plot different values of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$.
4. Find which Eigenvalue is dominant by seeing what happens as $t \to \infty$.
5. See what Eigenvalue is dominant as $t \to -\infty$.
6. Plot the lines with arbitrary $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ as $t \to \pm\infty$.
7. 

We can see that $\underline{x} =\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\end{pmatrix}$ is going to be a critical point.

To show that it is the only critical point we can show that $\det (a)$ is not singular.

$$
\det(a) = \begin{vmatrix}
5 & 2  \\
3 & 4
\end{vmatrix} = 20 - 6 = 14
$$
